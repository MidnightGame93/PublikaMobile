             	  <p>Publika is a creative retail, a new mall which stands out from the rest by sheer innovation. By creating and urban centre for creative activity, we attract life and life, as always, attracts commerce. Novel products, original concepts, a fresh niche market, a brand in evolution and merchandising with a difference. This is Publika. We unleash an artsy, edgy vision with a mix of fashion brands and independent boutiques, chain restaurants and cosy caf√©s. </p>

                  <p>The White Box is a 5000 sq ft open daylight filled space. It is mainly used for gallery exhibitions by various artists. It features an open plan space with flexi walls that allow for it to be transformed for each artists individual needs.</p>
            
                  <p>Occasionally, a display of artists' works-both locally and internationally-are featured here in the gallery, and is open to the public with free admission. Additionally, copies of their own personal limited edition artbooks are sold for a fair price. However, they are sold on a first come first serve basis, so we would like to apologize if we've run out of stock before you arrive.</p>

                  <p>The Black Box is a 5000 sq ft space with an option for 250 tiered seating or 300 floor-level seating. The space is sealed from daylight, and fully equipped with lighting and AV system. The Black Box is usually occupied by talk events as well as live band performances from local and international artistes'.</p>
                  
                  <p>Not too long ago, the LA Heavy Melodic Hardcore band called "The Ghost Inside featuring Hammerhead (the Finland Street Metal/Thrash artist) had performed here with tickets sold at Publika itself or any "Rock Corner" outlet. Music geek lovers, if you're interested in attending music gigs or even performing live on your own, here's the place for you!</p>

                  <p>The Art Row consists of 6 creative retail lots (ranging from 500-600sq ft) including the outdoor terrace (300 sq ft).</p>
                
                  <p>Basically, Art Row is a very special method for artists and designers to work on their stuff and to market them into the world. This is the type of opportunity which is very rare as no shopping malls would even consider carrying such an initiative. There is also the F.A.B (Fuyoh Art Bazaar) which is an arts bazaar that comes around every first Sunday of the month.</p>
                
                  <p>If you have your own little business that you'd like to put on display in our Art Row, feel free to contact us!</p>
